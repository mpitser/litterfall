Application and Scripts used for the Litterfall/Crum Woods Productivity Project
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Goal is to create a Web based access, entry, and analysis tool of long-term ecological datasets from the Crum Woods that border Swarthmore College.  


Front-end Interface is written in Javascript, HTML, CSS, with help from jQuery and a few frameworks: 
  Bootstrap for extra CSS styling and responsive design; 
  Backbone.js to separate code into meaningful components; 
  Require.js to separate components into different files
  
Back-end is supported by Python scripts interacting with a MongoDb. Scripts exist to migrate data from Excel spreadsheets and a MySQL database into MongoDB, as well as for interatction with the mongo database when users use the interface to enter, access, and analyze data.
